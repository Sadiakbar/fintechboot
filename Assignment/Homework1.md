# BORROWELL ![eduupkgbpa7l0pzb3z21 (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87621135/130178768-1fbf4a32-ff7b-4aba-8d99-ef0b722fb9a1.png)

Borrowell is a Canadian-origin fintech company operating as a marketplace platform for online lending. It attracts customers through free credit scores and uses their credit data to provide customized recommendations for financial products.


## Overview and Origin

One of Canada's leading FINTECH organizations to offer free credit scores and credit reports, Borrowell, was founded and incorporated by Andrew Graham and Eva Wong in 2014. Over the years, the founders have successfully built a diverse team of financial and technology experts to help Canadians make better financial decisions and serve as an alternative institution that provides financial services and products such as loans, mortgages, etc., at lower interest rates. 

Started with only $5.4 million in seed funding from Equitable Bank, Oakwest Corporation Limited, and notable individual investors Roger Martin, John Bitove, and Dan Debow, Borrowell has raised a total of $117.2M in funding over seven rounds. Their latest funding was raised in March 2021, from a Series C round. Borrowell is funded by 25 investors, which includes Silicon Valley Bank, White Star Capital, BDC Capital, and Kensington Capital Partners Limited are the most recent investors.

## Business Activities:

As highlighted earlier, Borrowell is considered one of the significant online lenders present in Canada today. By offering free credit scores, education, and weekly credit monitoring to its subscribers, Borrowell targets a simple objective of helping Canadians make better decisions about their credit.

As quoted by one of the founders, "In talking to consumers every day, we came to realize that many Canadians don't know their current credit score or how to improve it," said Andrew Graham, CEO, Borrowell. He further added, "The reality is that lenders across the country use credit scores to decide who qualifies for loans and at what price. By providing Canadians with their scores and educational resources on how to improve them, Canadians will have better options when it comes to accessing credit (Borrowell, 2021)." 

Thus, Borrowell is not only aiming to target the problem of creating more credit awareness, but with the adaptation of automated network and data, it can offer solutions in the form of products such as loans, savings accounts, and other financial tools tailored to each customer's unique goals and credit profile. Borrowell, unlike payday lenders, serves good credit Canadians who may be looking for better alternatives to high interest credit cards and inconvenient bank loans. Borrowell has already attracted around 1.6 million subscribers and average monthly website traffic of 1.5 million visitors. The digital lending platform has a market size valued at USD 4.87 billion in 2020 and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 24.0% from 2021 to 2028.

In the current booming world of Fintech, the following features give Borrowell the slight advantage setting it apart from its competitors:

* In partnership with Equifax, Borrowell's credit bureau, Borrowell provides more detailed reports that include the status of credit accounts, application dates, and occasionally payment history. Furthermore, subscribers can also compare their credit scores with the rest of Canada, so everyone has a comparative benchmark when trying to improve credit health.
* Borrowell also has a free bill tracking tool exclusive to the Borrowell app designed to help Canadians get ahead of their bills and keep their credit score healthy. 
* Borrowell competitors such as Mojo offers Canadians the opportunity to buy or invest in cryptocurrencies or Bitcoin. In comparison, Borrowell provides financial products and services that are not volatile but are relatively stable and within reach of an average Canadian.
* Borrowell also provides innovative digital tools like personalized credit coaching, and with the help of 'Molly,' its AI-powered credit coach, it presents recommendations and personalized tips that may help one understand and improve their credit and financial standing; a feature that is not offered by its competitors such as Mogo Finance Technology and Credit Karma.

To provide its aimed service and reach out to customers, Borrowell uses 27 technology products and services, including HTML5, Google Analytics, and jQuery, according to G2 Stack. According to BuiltWith, Borrowell is actively using 13 technologies on its website. These include Viewport Meta, iPhone / Mobile Compatible, and Google Font API. The technologies have been implemented so that the subscribers receive their recommendations without having any detrimental impact on their financial scores. 


## Landscape:

Since Borrowell provides credit management and consulting services and is also an online lending platform, providing personalized loan options to its customers with lower and more manageable interest rates, based on its current nature of services, Borrowell falls under two domains of the financial industry, Credit and Loan.

In recent years, the Banking & Financial industry's Credit and Loan domains have seen a continued and aggressive focus on digitization and the adoption of new and emerging technologies to improve operational efficiencies, accelerate time-to-market, and provide superior customer experiences. Many banks are constantly looking for ways to capitalise on the opportunities presented by digital technology, whether by leveraging the technologies in-house or by partnering with FinTech firms. Partnerships between banks and fintech companies are becoming more common, with the latter providing marketing, administration, loan servicing, or other services that allow banks to offer tech-enabled banking products. Banks are also discovering some additional benefits of bank-FinTech collaborations, such as access to assets and customers.

Furthermore, as new regulatory requirements and data protection laws put additional strains on already-stretched resources, emerging technologies such as AI and robotics are helping banks address these constraints efficiently. Banks realize the double benefits of optimizing costs while improving operations from using AI to power chatbots and providing round-the-clock, agile customer services to utilizing the technology for critical functions such as anti-fraud and regulatory compliance. Furthermore, robotic process automation and machine learning are assisting banks in replacing labor-intensive, manual workflows with highly reliable, cost-efficient, and fast robotic operations.

Other companies under these domains are :

*	Mogo Finance Technology Inc. is also a fast-growing Candian Fintech company; its headquarters based in Vancouver. Mogo operates an online lending platform to provide young people with various credit solutions, such as short-term loans and prepaid credit cards, thus maintaining a very similar profile to Borrowell. It is at times also considered as the Uber of finance. 
*	Credit Karma, an online personal finance company, has a similar profile to Borrowell. Credit Karma offers a variety of tools and personalized recommendations to assist customers in managing their money. The Company's goal is to help its customers with credit and identity monitoring, credit card recommendations, loan shopping (car, home, and personal), savings growth, and tax filing. 
*	Amigo Loans, founded in 2005, is considered UK's largest guarantor loan company. Amigo Loans aims to make borrowing possible and more accessible for people who are otherwise excluded from this option by mainstream lending providers. With its set-up, Amigo can offer feasible alternatives to high-cost loans, such as payday loans and other forms of non-standard finance. 
*	Pioneer Credit, a financial services provider, operates and is available to customers in Australia and New Zealand. The Company is highly focused on providing customers and users with exceptional levels of customer service and a range of products and solutions to help them achieve their financial goals. Customers can access these services through the web and the free app, Pioneer Path, and Pioneer's intuitive customer portal.

## Results

Most Canadians live paycheck to paycheck, and about 33% find it challenging to pay off their credit card debt. Borrowell's central goal is to address this situation by giving Canadians the tools they need to improve their credit score, discover and access better financial products, spend wisely, and save effortlessly. A point to note is that Canadians' digital adoption of Fintech is still less than half that of other markets of a similar size., but Borrowell is changing this. By providing free credit scores and access to relevant financial products, the Company has established itself as a trusted adviser to its Canadian customers.

Most recently, Borrowell has completed the acquisition of Refresh Financial, a leader in providing underserved Canadians with long-term access to affordable and sustainable credit, and raised $25 million in funding for the purchase and to support future growth. The acquisition doubles Borrowell's revenue and employee base. New investors in the $25 million round include Kensington Capital Partners, BDC Capital, iA Financial Group, and Impact Engine, a Chicago-based social impact-focused investment fund. New funding was also provided by existing investors Portag3 Ventures, White Star Capital, National Bank of Canada's NAventures, and Equitable Bank. This brings Borrowell's total equity financing to $55 million and accelerates its mission to help Canadians build their credit, make smart financial decisions, and achieve financial stability.

![Market Position](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87621135/130341080-036a0bb4-a89a-4e45-8a92-2acffb446a86.jpg)

53% of Borrowell users have less than 659, and a Refresh Financial client's average starting credit score is 500. However, through engagement with the Borrowell platform, users can improve their credit score by demonstrating 171+ points in 24 months. Borrowell has already shown its ability to establish financial prosperity for its user base by raising its users' credit scores, lowering their cost of borrowing, making budgeting more manageable, and increasing their savings. This acquisition and round of funding will amplify that impact by allowing the Company to serve more non-prime credit seekers and offer a broader range of products and services to meet the diverse needs of each user.

Fintech continues to change how the traditional financial market operates and becomes the segmented intersection of financial services and innovative technologies. Fintech can influence the financial market in several main areas; by increasing competition, empowering consumers, democratizing access to financial services, especially in developing countries, and, as a consequence, stimulating further innovation by creating new investment opportunities for existing financial institutions. Thus, the question arises, how do we measure the success of a Fintech company? Should we base it on the traditional FinTech KPI's such as:

*	Operating Cash Flow (OCF), which gives us the total amount of money generated by a company's day-to-day business operations. This financial metric focuses on whether the Company   can maintain a positive cash flow for growth or may or may not require external funding to meet all expenses.
*	Gross Profit Margin, which is considered one of the best indicators of a company's financial health by measuring the amount of money left in revenue after deducting the cost of   goods sold.
*	Burn Rate, which is a financial KPI that reflects how a company spends money weekly, monthly, or annually. This basic metric can quickly help small businesses without doing       extensive financial analysis. And when compared to gross profit margin and revenue, the burn rate gives insight into whether the costs of the organizations are sustainable over   the long term.

However, these indicators, among many others, may not be enough to measure and compare the success of fintech companies in such a highly competitive industry. Thereby, we should also consider the following metrics:

*	Customer metrics, which measure the number of new and repeat customers, number of registered customers, bounce rate, and audience demographics.
*	Marketing metrics, which measures reach, response rate, customer conversion rate, number clicks, etc
*	And other financial metrics, such as cost per visitor, marketing spend, etc. 

However, fintech startups should remember that measuring success in the fintech industry isn't just about looking at the metrics but also knowing how they interplay. To properly analyze your fintech business, you must map the relationships between your app's performance, marketing efforts, and business results to obtain meaningful indicators. In the Credit and Loan domain as Borrowell's, the following examples would help attribute the Company's success and how well they are performing in comparison to competitors:

*	Measuring credit scores before and after individuals subscribe to and utilize online lending companies' services and receive their financial services.
*	Monitoring instances whether their customers are paying their bills on time or are there any delinquencies in their payment history, etc.
*	Ensuring that their customers can quickly get loan and mortgage approvals from alternate financial institutions with competitive and lower interest rates, etc.
  Suppose the customer's credit score improves after he/she has started receiving financial services from the Company. There are fewer late bills or reduction of delinquencies in   their payment history, and that their customers are able to get loan, mortgage approvals easily at competitive interest rates. In that case, it implies that they are performing   well. 

When it comes to measuring success, Borrowell has been able to accomplish the following: 

*	The average credit score of over 1 million Canadian Borrowell members increased by 18 points in the past year, from 649 (below average) in Q1 2020 to 667 (fair) in Q1 2021. This   is despite the fact the world being in lockdown for almost two years.
*	Over the same period, the average number of missed payments per consumer decreased by 33% from 0.300 to 0.200 per credit report, or from 3 missed payments per 10 consumers to 2   missed payments per 10 consumers.


## Recommendations

Considering the ever-changing dynamics of technology, it is essential to understand that FinTech companies should be willing and ready to offer newer and better services and options to customers to have better outreach and be able to retain their existing market hold. And therefore, Borrowell should also focus on what different services their competitors offer, which currently Borrowell is not offering. And what else they can provide in addition to that. Some examples could be:

*	They focus on further easing loan restrictions for customers. And provide them more comprehensive options in terms of the duration when customers can pay off their loans.         Currently, Borrowell requires customers to either pay loans during a two or three years' period.
*	Range of amounts that a customer can borrow can be extended. Borrowell allows customers to carry only one loan at a time. You can only apply for between $1,000 and $35,000         while, Banks and Fintech lenders typically offer personal loans of between $500 and $50,000. However, this option could serve as an advantage and disadvantage simultaneously as   the amount and age of a loan can negatively affect the customers credit scores.
*	Borrowell should consider offering (Industrial Credit) which includes provision of Credit coaching and financial services to large firms and companies.
*	Consider developing a safe and reliable platform for cryptocurrency trading or buying and selling of bitcoin like MogoCrypto (Mogo).
  
  To be able to indulge in and provide some of these recommendations, Borrowell could utilize the following technologies:

*	Regtech: Some of the essential characteristics of Regtech include agility, speed, integration, and analytics. Regtech can quickly separate and organize cluttered and intertwined   data sets through extract and transfer load technologies. Regtech can also be used to generate reports quickly and get solutions running swiftly in a short amount of time for     integration purposes. Finally, Regtech uses analytic tools to mine big data sets and use them for different purposes. With the help of Regtech, Borrowell can quickly monitor and   regulate the data that would allow them to improve its loan offering strategies to its customers and increase without harming the revenue and reputation of the Company.           Indirectly, Regtech can also offer Borrowell better Risk Management strategies. 

*	BlockChain: Will provide cybersecurity and provide a safe platform for trading Cryptocurrencies. The expansion of a variety of services will help Borrowell expand its customer     market size and offer them a competitive advantage in the market that its competitors do not have. 

*	Nsure: Together with BlockChain, can help Borrowell establish a reputation of reliable online database that can protect sensitive information of individuals, small business        owner information, and information of large firms and companies. This way, they will be able to offer services and products related to Industrial Credit.

One can argue that Borrowell is just as secure as the traditional bank. Still, given the progression in the Fintech industry, Banks and insurance companies increasingly invest and buy out fintech companies as part of their (broader) investment portfolio. Some are also sponsoring fintech incubators to create investment opportunities and by improving financial supervision. In general, the industry has seen various forms of collaboration between traditional banks and Fintech. If Fintech was viewed as a potential threat to banks and the banking industry in general, some time ago, now they talk about cooperation and mutual benefit.
