Borrowell is a Canadian-origin fintech company operating as a marketplace platform for online lending. It attracts customers through free credit scores and uses their credit data to provide customized recommendations for financial products. 1

## Overview and Origin

One of Canada's leading FINTECH organizations to offer free credit scores and credit reports, Borrowell, was founded and incorporated by Andrew Graham and Eva Wong in 2014. Over the years, the founders have successfully built a diverse team of financial and technology experts to help Canadians make better financial decisions and serve as an alternative institution that provides financial services and products such as loans, mortgages, etc., at lower interest rates. 

Started with only $5.4 million in seed funding from Equitable Bank, Oakwest Corporation Limited, and notable individual investors Roger Martin, John Bitove, and Dan Debow, Borrowell has raised a total of $117.2M in funding over seven rounds. Their latest funding was raised in March 2021, from a Series C round. Borrowell is funded by 25 investors, which includes Silicon Valley Bank, White Star Capital, BDC Capital, and Kensington Capital Partners Limited are the most recent investors.

## Business Activities:

As highlighted earlier, Borrowell is considered one of the significant online lenders present in Canada today. By offering free credit scores, education, and weekly credit monitoring to its subscribers, Borrowell targets a simple objective of helping Canadians make better decisions about their credit. 

Quoted from one of the founders, "In talking to consumers every day, we came to realize that many Canadians don't know their current credit score or how to improve it," said Andrew Graham, CEO, Borrowell. He further added, "The reality is that lenders across the country use credit scores to decide who qualifies for loans and at what price. By providing Canadians with their scores and educational resources on how to improve them, Canadians will have better options when it comes to accessing credit." 2

Thus, with the adaptation of automated network and data, Borrowell can offer products such as loans, savings accounts, and other financial tools tailored to each customer's unique goals and credit profile. Unlike payday lenders, who target people with poor credit, Borrowell serves good credit Canadians who may be seeking better alternatives to higher interest credit cards and inconvenient bank loans. Borrowell has already attracted around 1.6 million subscribers and average monthly website traffic of 1.5 million visitors. The digital lending platform has a market size valued at USD 4.87 billion in 2020 and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 24.0% from 2021 to 2028.

In the current booming world of Fintech, the following features give Borrowell the slight advantage setting it apart from its competitors:

•	  In partnership with Equifax, Borrowell's credit bureau, Borrowell provides more detailed reports that include the status of credit accounts, application dates, and occasionally payment history. Furthermore, subscribers can also compare their credit scores with the rest of Canada, so everyone has a comparative benchmark when trying to improve credit health.
•	  Borrowell also has a free bill tracking tool exclusive to the Borrowell app designed to help Canadians get ahead of their bills and keep their credit score healthy. 
•	  Borrowell competitors such as Mojo offers Canadians the opportunity to buy or invest in cryptocurrencies or Bitcoin. In comparison, Borrowell provides financial products and services that are not volatile but are relatively stable and within reach of an average Canadian.
•	B orrowell also provides innovative digital tools like personalized credit coaching, and with the help of 'Molly,' its AI-powered credit coach, it presents recommendations and personalized tips that may help one understand and improve their credit and financial standing; a feature that is not offered by its competitors such as Mogo Finance Technology and Credit Karma.

To provide its aimed service and reach out to customers, Borrowell uses 27 technology products and services, including HTML5, Google Analytics, and jQuery, according to G2 Stack. Borrowell is actively using 13 technologies for its website, according to BuiltWith. These include Viewport Meta, iPhone / Mobile Compatible, and Google Font API. The technologies have been implemented so that the subscribers receive their recommendations without having any detrimental impact on their financial scores. 

## Landscape:

Since Borrowell provides credit management and consulting services and is also an online lending platform, providing personalized loan options to its customers with lower and more manageable interest rates. Borrowell falls under two domains of the financial industry, Credit and Loan. 

The Banking & Financial industry is witnessing a continued and aggressive focus on digitization and adopting new and emerging technologies to bring in operational efficiencies, enhance speed-to-market and deliver superior customer experiences. Many banks are seeking to exploit the opportunities presented by digital, either by leveraging the technologies in-house or by partnering with FinTech companies. Bank-FinTech partnerships are increasingly becoming the norm, with the latter providing marketing, administration, loan servicing, or other services enabling banks to offer tech-enabled banking products. Banks are also discovering some other advantages of bank-FinTech partnerships, including access to assets and customers. As a result, these partnerships are beginning to reshape the financial services landscape. 

Furthermore, as new regulatory requirements and data protection laws put additional strains on already-stretched resources, emerging technologies such as AI and robotics are helping banks address these constraints efficiently. Banks realize the double benefits of optimizing costs while improving operations from using AI to power chatbots and providing round-the-clock, agile customer services to utilizing the technology for critical functions such as anti-fraud and regulatory compliance. Additionally, technologies such as Robotic Process Automation and machine learning are helping banks replace labor-intensive, manual workflows with highly reliable, cost-efficient, and fast robotic operations.

Five Canadian fintech companies making a name for themselves by providing innovative financial solutions for customers other than Borrowell are Payfirma, Quandl, Mogo, Shopify, and Cryptologic. Payfirma is a Vancouver-based payment processing company that operates on a cloud-based platform, allowing business analytics, such as sales data, to be retrieved easily. Quandl, founded in 2012, provides access to extensive financial, economic, and social datasets from companies such as NASDAQ, Zacks Investment Research, and Zillow Group Inc. Mogo Finance Technology Inc., sometimes considered the Uber of finance, operates an online lending platform aimed at providing young people with a variety of credit solutions, such as short-term loans and prepaid credit cards. Shopify provides a cloud-based multichannel commerce platform for businesses of all sizes. Cryptologic Corp. began as a web-based business-to-business (B2B) risk management and payment solutions but now operates as a cryptocurrency miner and blockchain application development company.

Fintech is changing how the traditional financial market operates and is one of the fastest-growing segments at the intersection of financial services and innovative technologies. Fintech can influence the financial market in several main areas; by increasing competition, empowering consumers, democratizing access to financial services, especially in developing countries, and, as a consequence, stimulating further innovation by creating new investment opportunities for existing financial institutions. Banks and insurance companies increasingly invest and buy out fintech companies as part of their (broader) investment portfolio. Some are also sponsoring fintech incubators to create investment opportunities and by improving financial supervision. In general, the industry has seen various forms of collaboration between traditional banks and Fintech. If Fintech was viewed as a potential threat to banks and the banking industry in general, some time ago, now they talk about cooperation and mutual benefit. Fintech companies can support banks by providing specific services, solutions, such as risk analysis services.   

Most recently, Borrowell has completed the acquisition of Refresh Financial, a leader in providing underserved Canadians with long-term access to affordable and sustainable credit, and raised $25 million in funding for the purchase and to support future growth. The acquisition doubles Borrowell's revenue and employee base. The $25 million funding round includes new investors Kensington Capital Partners, BDC Capital, iA Financial Group, and Impact Engine, a Chicago-based social impact-focused investment fund. Existing investors Portag3 Ventures, White Star Capital, National Bank of Canada's NAventures, and Equitable Bank also participated with new funding. This brings Borrowell's total equity financing to $55 million and accelerates its mission to help Canadians build their credit, make smart financial decisions, and achieve financial stability.

The combined entity will target the underserved subprime credit population. 53% of Borrowell users have less than 659, and a Refresh Financial client's average starting credit score is 500. However, through engagement with the Borrowell platform, users can improve their credit score by demonstrating 171+ points in 24 months. Borrowell has already shown its ability to establish financial prosperity for its user base by raising its users' credit scores, lowering their cost of borrowing, making budgeting more manageable, and increasing their savings. This acquisition and round of funding will amplify that impact by enabling the company to serve more non-prime credit seekers and provide a broader suite of products and services that meet the diverse needs of each user.
